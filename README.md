# Sage

Sage is similar to Mint. It's a personal financial tracker and manager, built using Addepar's Open Source libraries and intended to be linked against Addepar's financial data API.

Sage is an open-source project built for Addepar's 2014 Hackathon. It's based on [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) by Stefan Penner.
